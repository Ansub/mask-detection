# Mask Detection 
seeing the increase in the covid-19 cases and the lack of social distancing and usaage of Mask, i made a mask detecting application using Keras/tensorflow and OpenCV.this can detect whether people are wearing face mask or not. If they are wearing it, green square will appear on their face, if they are not wearing it then red square will appear on their face.

## Requirements
- Tensorflow
- CV2
- NumPY
- MobileNetV2

## Installation
- Clone the repository
 ```bash
 git clone git@github.com:Ansub/mask-detection.git
```
- Download the trained model and dataset from <a href="http://bit.ly/ansub-mask-detection"> Here <a>

## Usage
- install the requirements
- download the dataset and put all of them inside the cloned folder
- assgined the path inside the  notebook of the files required 
- run mask_detection.ipynb in Juypter Notebooks

and there you have it. a working model  which can detect the faces using webcam.
