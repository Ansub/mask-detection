# Mask Detection 
seeing the increase in the covid-19 cases and tha lack of social distancing and usaage of Mask, i thought of making a mask detection application using Keras/tensorflow and OpenCV.

## Requirements
- Tensorflow
- CV2
- NumPY
- MobileNetV2

## Installation
- Clone the repository
 ```bash
 git clone git@github.com:Ansub/mask-detection.git
```
- Download the trained model and dataset from <a href="http://bit.ly/ansub-mask-detection"> Here <a>

## Usage
- install the requirements
- download the dataset and put all of them inside the cloned folder
- assgined the path inside the  notebook of the files required 
- run mask_detection.ipynb in Juypter Notebooks

and there you have it. a working model  which can detect the faces using webcam.
